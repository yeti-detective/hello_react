# hello_react

following the VERY handy tutorial found here:
https://www.codementor.io/tamizhvendan/beginner-guide-setup-reactjs-environment-npm-babel-6-webpack-du107r9zr

This app is to become my resume. I will re-create another repository later for an empty React environment.
Use 'npm run watch' to run webpack in watch mode (detects React component updates and compiles to bundle.js automatically)
