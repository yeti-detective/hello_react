    <h3>My story</h3>
      <p>I've been working in technology since 2011 when I got my first IT job.</p>
      <p>
        I developed the scripting skills I picked up in IT into a full-blown love of
        programming and app development after discovering Zed Shaw's book, <em>Learn
        Python the Hard Way</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first embarassing creation was a dating sim
        made in <a href="https://www.renpy.org/" target="_blank">RenPy</a>. You
        can download the latest, still unfinished, build <a href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByJ-Z6PsQ_D1VGlpV2pIME9HQ28'>
        here</a>. That's a PC build, but I can produce a Mac build also if requested
       (who would request that?)
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite thing about developing for the web is that you can create
        things very quickly straight from your imagination into reality, and then
        immediately show people those things that you've created! And when people
        see the things you've created they go, "oh, cool," and you know in that
        moment that you've really changed their life in that moment...
